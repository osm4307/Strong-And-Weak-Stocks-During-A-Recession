# Strong-And-Weak-Stocks-During-A-Recession

### About Project
- The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused an extreme shock to the global economy and financial markets, leading to contrasting stock price movements across different sectors. This project aims to analyze the stock price fluctuations of the S&P 500 companies, identify strong and relatively weak companies during a recession, and derive common characteristics based on their stock growth rates.

### Key Questions:
- What are the characteristics and causes of stock price decline among companies in the Consumer Staples sector, which performed well during the COVID-19 pandemic?

- What are the characteristics and causes of stock price increases among companies in the Energy sector, which performed poorly during the COVID-19 pandemic?

- What common factors can be identified from the above two cases?

### Project Progression Steps

#### Step 1: Data Collection and Cleaning
- Obtain a list of the S&P 500 companies, select relevant information, and categorize the companies into the Consumer Staples sector, which performed relatively well during the COVID-19 period, and the Energy sector, which was vulnerable.

#### Step 2: Data Analysis & Visualization
1. List stock price growth rates for the Consumer Staples sector, which performed strongly during the COVID-19 period -> Select the 5 companies with the lowest growth rates.

2. List stock price growth rates for the Energy sector, which performed poorly during the COVID-19 period -> Select the 5 companies with the highest growth rates.

3. Visualize the listed stock price growth rates for each sector using Scatter Plots.

4. Visualize the 5 companies with the lowest and highest growth rates, as identified in the data analysis step, using line charts.

5. For the company with the lowest growth rate in the Consumer Staples sector, display a wider date range in the stock price chart and analyze the reasons for the price decline.

6. For the company with the highest growth rate in the Energy sector, display a wider date range in the stock price chart and analyze the reasons for the price increase.

#### Step 3: Conclusion
- Investigate the conditions required to identify strong companies during economic recessions, particularly in exceptional situations like the COVID-19 pandemic.

- Through this project, we aim to identify companies with high resilience during recession, providing insights for portfolio rebalancing strategies in future macroeconomic shocks.

### What I learned after finishing the project
- There were many project plan revisions during the project. This made me realize once again that I need to establish a concrete project plan.

- I regret not being able to handle the various visual elements within Python. In the next project, I would like to create a more professional project by including machine learning elements.
